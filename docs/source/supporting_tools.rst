Supporting Tools
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

.. todo:: describe these tools in detail

These tools assist in the curation and representation of gene fusion data. To do this,
they must choose conventions that are not defined in these guidelines, specifically around
data exchange. For example, these implementations choose to use `SequenceLocation`_ from the
Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) `Variation Representation Specification (VRS)`_,
due to its use of inter-residue coordinates and extensible design. Other implementations may choose
different conventions for representation of gene fusion data in system exchange.
