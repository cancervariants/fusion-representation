Community Feedback and Endorsements
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This specification was initially developed through consensus building among key stakeholders with expertise in
clinical variant diagnostics and informatics.

However, for widespread adoption, it is important that broader community input is considered and included in the
continued development of this specification and alignment across the many stakeholders interested in the representation
of gene fusions. If you have feedback to provide on the specification, please leave feedback on our
on our `GitHub issue tracker`_ or `Google form`_.

Below is a summary the alignment efforts for this version of the specification (|branch|):

HUGO Nomenclature Committees
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
This specification has been reviewed by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC), the HGVS Variation Nomenclature
Committee (HVNC), and the International System for Human Cytogenomic Nomenclature (ISCN) nomenclature committee. The
specification is in alignment with the recommendations of those committees and has received their endorsement as a
consensus specification for the definition and description of gene fusions.
