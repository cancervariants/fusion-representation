Gene Fusion Guidelines
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

.. warning::
   These guidelines are in a **draft** state, assembled by consensus through a cross-consortia initiative with
   representatives from multiple professional societies. However,
   this draft has not yet been evaluated for formal endorsement by any professional society. Community alignment
   status is organized on GitHub and summarized at :ref:`feedback`.
   We will also submit a manuscript to endorsing organizations.

The Gene Fusion Guidelines are a collection of recommendations for the precise representation of gene fusions, assembled
by a cross-consortia initiative between members of the `Clinical Genome (ClinGen) Somatic Cancer Clinical Domain Working Group <https://clinicalgenome.org/working-groups/clinical-domain/somatic-cancer-cdwg/>`_,
the `Cancer Genomics Consortium <https://cancergenomics.org/>`_,
the `Cytogenetics Committee of the College of American Pathologists (CAP) and the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) <https://www.cap.org/member-resources/councils-committees/cap-acmg-cytogenetics-committee/>`_,
and the `Variant Interpretation for Cancer Consortium <https://www.cancervariants.org/projects/fusions>`_.

The guidelines provide a precise definition, minimal information model, and nomenclature for both assayed and
categorical gene fusions. These guidelines incorporate, extend, and refine related standards, including the
`HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) recommendations for the designation of gene fusions <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41375-021-01436-6>`_.
